Architect, Open Data and Standards, W3C

 - Talk about what standards are, and how they are made
 - W3C speak for a standard is "recommendation"
 - Standards building is a game of werewolf. Everyone has their agenda. Balancing the needs of peoples agendas are key to good outcomes.
 - Standards push things towards commodity, but some things might be best left in product/commodity
 - For example private browsing is different in each browser. Complexity does disservice to users. Hampers innovation for the rest of the web.
 - Browsers prefer to innovate on their own.
 - Some features of private browsing may be in different places on the x-axis of a Wardley map.
 - WebRTC standard emerges from proprietary tech like Sype, Facetime. (Does WebRTC potentially makes these things interoperable?)
 - Presentation API: 1st + 2nd screen. Presentations + speaker notes, Game + controller, media "flinging" (Chromecast)
 - Vehicle information service data: various vehicle metrics - technical and infotainment systems. Control you car from your phone, have a virtual manual on your phone (see your oil level)
 - WebVR demo 
 - Community groups in custom->product space, working group & recommendation track in the product->commodity space
 - Good standards start with implementations
 - EMEA. Challenge we were faced with was that the big players were going to do a thing anyway, possibly with less transparency, less concerns addressed.
 - Rec. track is when things start to get very stable, and you can start to build things on top
