# James Findlay and James Duncan

... Missed first half of talk

- Von Neumann & his contribution of computing
 - ENIAC, for calculating the trajectory of artillery shells was being built
 - Von N had been working on Manhattan Project, but worked out that ENIAC could be modified to a general purpose machine
 - He got it to do a load of work on atom bomb things
 - EDVAC paper proposed architecture which we still use today in x86 and similar
 - Von N made use of commodity valves... as if he had a map
