 - Cynefin (sounds like "kern-ev-in")
 - Epiphany vs Apophany
 - Apophany, Claus Konrad coined, means the kind of epiphany schizophrenics have: seeing patterns that aren't there.
 - Example: a photo of the surface of Mars that looks like an elephant.
 - Some conservation groups don't recognise the discovery that there are two species of African elephants, because their tracking systems can't cope
 - Apophenia simultaneously extremely useful and highly hazardous
 - We filter the data we observe
 - Beliefs dictate how we filter data: this produces confirmation bias
 - Pareidolia, actor-observer bias, Google effect... there are so many biases we suffer from
 - Our brains are broken when it comes to understanding uncertainty
 - There is an assuption that there is order and predictability
 - Cynefin framework. Obvious things, complicated things, chaos, complexity
 - Obvious things, complicated things => predictable outcomes
 - Chaos => need to act quickly
 - Complex => cause and effect can be correlated, but only in retrospect
 - Obvious: sense, categorise, respond
 - Complicated: sense, analyse, respond
 - Chaotic: act, sense, respond
 - Complex: probe, sense, respond
 - Emergent outcomes, processes
 - In the middle is disorder, we can Eapply our preferred pattern to disorder but it tends to chaos
 - Systems are complex and adaptive, agents can change the system
 - Estimating complexity
 - 5: Nobody has ever done it before
 - 4: Someone outside the org has
 - 3: Someone in the company has done it
 - 2: Someone in the team has
 - 1: We all know how to do it
 - 5 to 1 moves from complex to obvious
 - Things that are 1s: should they be commodities?
 - Safe-to-fail Rpbes: know if it's succeeding or not? Have lever to dampen or amplify. Coherence: a realistic reason to think the probes might succeed.
 - Coherence: "Can you give me an example"
 - BDD approaches: given x then y, z
 - We often don't try things because there's a "but it won't work" voice in our heads
 - Correlation in retrospect
 - Second order effects: more police on the street = more crime reported because people reporting crime to them
 - Cognitive Edge "Sensemaker", gathers
 - Identify "dispositions" in systems, find ways to change from bad ones to good ones
 - Where is change landing and succeeding? Listen out.
 - Use existing disposition
 - Complexity is dominated by relationships. Don't just think about nodes, think about relationships. That's what you are changing.
 - Relentless positivity. If you want to get things going you need to be relentless.
 - Get people started, break the initial inertia.
 - We notice what we do wrong more than what we do right.
