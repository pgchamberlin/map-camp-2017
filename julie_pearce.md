 - Ensure the food you eat is safe, and is what it says it is
 - Vast estate outsourced to Crapita
 - About half were "shadow IT"
 - Brexit would require vast changes. No idea what would be required.
 - Decision to crack on and get out of Crapita and work it out as they went along.
 - Undaunted by perception of "many dragons' being there, they went and mapped it all
 - Lots of duplication, lots of complexity, many things too far left
 - Plan to start at the bottom: uncontroversial as far down the value chain, things that won't be affected by EU exit
 - Lots of savings made by moving infra
 - Phase of tidying up
 - Untangling Capita contract using mapping
 - 90% of what we do is exactly the same
 - Design everything in future as if we are the most boring, bog standard regular, or other organisation
 - Next stage map leverages commodity in bottom right
 - Modern, simple, cheaper things that work well. People don't mind they are not "special", they like the better tools.
 - What about the uncertainty? Well, on the basis we're 90% the same as anything else we'll be able to adapt.
