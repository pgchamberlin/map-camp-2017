#Â Chris Adams

 - Mapping by Example
 - How do I talk about what's hapening in my org?
 - Business model canvas? Product roadmap?
 - Tells me the what and the now, but not the why and the future
 - We are planning to detect icebergs by ramming them
 - Useful features of maps: anchor: keep user in the picture, position: how are we set up to meet their needs?, movement: how might things change
 - Maps help with movement in a  unique way, are information dense, and explicit
 - Mapped value chain for website company + added evolution
 - It looks messy at first, that's fine
 - Client doesn't say "good job on configuring Postgres Chris!". Doesn't happen.
 - Will I get better at ops than Amazon? No
 - Will clients expect us to be familiar with the things on the right? Yes.
 - Growing Communities company in Hackney. Legacy website, lots of problems. What to do? Map.
 - What the core user need? Veg boxes.
 - Spent a couple of times looking into writing an open source thing but found out how hard it is
 - "Mapunditry"
 - How the battle of cloud was lost example. Map Amazon vs traditional.
 - Another example: Why would FB send the GDP of Iceland on WhatsApp?
 - Monetizing the social graph: the people who know each other
 - WhatsApp was a messaging app choking FBs value chain: keep in touch with your family without eyeballs in front of FB ads
