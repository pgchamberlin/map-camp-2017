# Notes from Map Camp 2017

Map Camp 2017 was a single day conference on Wardley mapping, held in London: http://www.map-camp.com/

This repo is a document of that event based on my (sparse) notes.

## Contribute to these notes

If you were at Map Camp and have your own notes please add them to this repo by raising a pull request. It would be great to add things like Twitter handles for speakers, and if you are one of the speakers please add a link to your slides if possible.

Chris Adams
 - Mapping by Example
 - How do I talk about what's hapening in my org?
 - Business model canvas? Product roadmap?
 - Tells me the what and the now, but not the why and the future
 - We are planning to detect icebergs by ramming them
 - Useful features of maps: anchor: keep user in the picture, position: how are we set up to meet their needs?, movement: how might things change
 - Maps help with movement in a  unique way, are information dense, and explicit
 - Mapped value chain for website company + added evolution
 - It looks messy at first, that's fine
 - Client doesn't say "good job on configuring Postgres Chris!". Doesn't happen.
 - Will I get better at ops than Amazon? No
 - Will clients expect us to be familiar with the things on the right? Yes.
 - Growing Communities company in Hackney. Legacy website, lots of problems. What to do? Map.
 - What the core user need? Veg boxes.
 - Spent a couple of times looking into writing an open source thing but found out how hard it is
 - "Mapunditry"
 - How the battle of cloud was lost example. Map Amazon vs traditional.
 - Another example: Why would FB send the GDP of Iceland on WhatsApp?
 - Monetizing the social graph: the people who know each other
 - WhatsApp was a messaging app choking FBs value chain: keep in touch with your family without eyeballs in front of FB ads
 - How to get practice mapping? 
 - AWMUG (Amateur Wardley Mapping User Group)
 - https://awmug.org

Liz Keogh
 - Cynefin (sounds like "kernevin")
 - Epiphany vs Apophany
 - Apophany, Claus Konrad coined, means the kind of epiphany schizophrenics have: seeing patterns that aren't there.
 - Example: a photo of the surface of Mars that looks like an elephant.
 - Some conservation groups don't recognise the discovery that there are two species of African elephants, because their tracking systems can't cope
 - Apophenia simultaneously extremely useful and highly hazardous
 - We filter the data we observe
 - Beliefs dictate how we filter data: this produces confirmation bias
 - Pareidolia, actor-observer bias, Google effect... there are so many biases we suffer from
 - Our brains are broken when it comes to understanding uncertainty
 - There is an assuption that there is order and predictability
 - Cynefin framework. Obvious things, complicated things, chaos, complexity
 - Obvious things, complicated things => predictable outcomes
 - Chaos => need to act quickly
 - Complex => cause and effect can be correlated, but only in retrospect
 - Obvious: sense, categorise, respond
 - Complicated: sense, analyse, respond
 - Chaotic: act, sense, respond
 - Complex: probe, sense, respond
 - Emergent outcomes, processes
 - In the middle is disorder, we can Eapply our preferred pattern to disorder but it tends to chaos
 - Systems are complex and adaptive, agents can change the system
 - Estimating complexity
 - 5: Nobody has ever done it before
 - 4: Someone outside the org has
 - 3: Someone in the company has done it
 - 2: Someone in the team has
 - 1: We all know how to do it
 - 5 to 1 moves from complex to obvious
 - Things that are 1s: should they be commodities?
 - Safe-to-fail Rpbes: know if it's succeeding or not? Have lever to dampen or amplify. Coherence: a realistic reason to think the probes might succeed.
 - Coherence: "Can you give me an example"
 - BDD approaches: given x then y, z
 - We often don't try things because there's a "but it won't work" voice in our heads
 - Correlation in retrospect
 - Second order effects: more police on the street = more crime reported because people reporting crime to them
 - Cognitive Edge "Sensemaker", gathers
 - Identify "dispositions" in systems, find ways to change from bad ones to good ones
 - Where is change landing and succeeding? Listen out.
 - Use existing disposition
 - Complexity is dominated by relationships. Don't just think about nodes, think about relationships. That's what you are changing.
 - Relentless positivity. If you want to get things going you need to be relentless.
 - Get people started, break the initial inertia.
 - We notice what we do wrong more than what we do right.


James Findlay & James Duncan
 ... Missed first half of talk
 - Von Neumann & his contribution of computing
 - ENIAC, for calculating the trajectory of artillery shells was being built
 - Von N had been working on Manhattan Project, but worked out that ENIAC could be modified to a general purpose machine
 - He got it to do a load of work on atom bomb things
 - EDVAC paper proposed architecture which we still use today in x86 and similar
 - Von N made use of commodity valves... as if he had a map

Adrian Cockcroft, @adrianco
 - Mapping AI
 - VP at AWS
 - OSS programme at AWS
 - Was at Netflix doing OSS
 - Part of Cloud Native Foundation
 - AI was a thing, and they identified MXNet as an academic project they might sponsor
 - They had a go at mapping MXNet
 - Improve docs, make easier to migrate from TensorFlow
 - Move it from being a uni project to be incubated by Apache
 - Simon W contributed to the maps, introduced concept of pipeline for research (custom) to pre-trained models
 - Introduced plays such as investing in high level frameworks for MXNet, partner (and control supply) of best new GPU chips (NVIDIA) etc.
 - Looked at every team in Amazon and what they are doing in AI: shops team etc.
 - MXNet used by WolframAlpha, Pinterest, self driving car systems
 - Future state map: commoditised everything, academia continues to feed the models

Tal Klein
 - Mapping in the context of science fiction
 - Think about Dr Evil's motivation in Austin Powers: world domination
 - Strategy: sharks with frikkin' laser beams
 - Actually sharks are not a commodity. To achieve sharks with laser beams he'd have to become the most ecologically friendly supervillain ever.
 - There were a load of bad assumptions.
 - We assume that maps solve our strategy problems. We can't draw maps to justify our conclusions.
 - The Martian does it well.
 - Ready Player One makes a fundamental assumption: everyone will be plugged into a VR framework. Mixed reality actually more likely.
 - To take another supervillain... like Putin. Leverage commodity things, like social media, and add propaganda and fake news etc.!
 - In the Punch Escrow he writes about a future where he has used mapping to try to work out what it will look like.
