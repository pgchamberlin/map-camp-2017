Liam Maxwell 
 - Gov must move from silos to platforms
 - Introduction of open standards and data
 - Coding in the open means sharing
 - Common standards means common tools
 - Outcome based teams
 - Change needs spend controls
 - Square of despair: procurement, security, legacy, capability
 - Institute for Government encouraged tyranny of agile
 - How can we get to AGILE(tm)? Doing it properly
 - Mapping tells us which techniques to use
 - Cassian Young: how would you do this in a dept. and how would you use a map?
 - Mapped incident management using maps
 - Identified utilities, things that could be SaaS
 - Identified areas of custom
 - What's up with hosting?
 - Gov spending Â£1.6bn per year on hosting
 - Lots of hosting comes with added lock-in in contract
 - Gov lock ins broken by Crown Hosting, the "Hotel California" where you check in your legacy but where it can never leave
 - Depts can then move on
 - Used open to unlock change
 - Competition could then drive technology model
 - High degree of open source
 - High engagement from SMEs
 - What is a minimum viable agency?
 - PaaS, Registers, Open source -> multidisciplinary teams -> GOV.UK, supported by user research, continuous delivery


Hadley Beeman
 - Architect, Open Data and Standards, W3C
 - Talk about what standards are, and how they are made
 - W3C speak for standards is "recommendation"
 - Standards building is a game of werewolf. Everyone has their agenda. Balancing the needs of peoples agendas are key to good outcomes.
 - Standards push things towards commodity, but some things might be best left in product/commodity
 - Private browsing is different in each browser. Complexity does disservice to users. Hampers innovation for the rest of the web.
 - Browsers prefer to innovate on their own.
 - Some features of private browsing, for example, may be in different places on the x-axis of a Wardley map.
 - WebRTC emerges from proprietary tech like Sype, Facetime. WebRTC makes these things interoperable (???)
 - Presentation API: 1st + 2nd screen. Presentations + speaker notes, Game + controller, media "flinging" (Chromecast)
 - Vehicle information service data: various vehicle metrics - technical and infotainment systems. Control you car from your phone, have a virtual manual on your phone (see your oil level)
 - WebVR
 - Community groups in custom->product space, working group & recommendation track in the product->commodity space
 - Good standards start with implementations
 - EMEA. Challenge we were faced with was that the big players were going to do a thing anyway, possibly with less transparency, less concerns addressed.
 - Rec. track is when things start to get very stable, and you can start to build things on top

Julie Pearce
 - Openness, Data, and Digital, Food Standards Agency
 - Delivering new tech + digi services for FSA
 - Ensure the food you eat is safe, and is what it says it is
 - Vast estate outsourced to Crapita
 - About half were "shadow IT"
 - Brexit would require vast changes. No idea what would be required.
 - Decision to crack on and get out of Crapita and work it out as they went along.
 - Undaunted by perception of "many dragons' being there, they went and mapped it all
 - Lots of duplication, lots of complexity, many things too far left
 - Plan to start at the bottom: uncontroversial as far down the value chain, things that won't be affected by EU exit
 - Lots of savings made by moving infra
 - Phase of tidying up
 - Untangling Capita contract using mapping
 - 90% of what we do is exactly the same
 - Design everything in future as if we are the most boring, bog standard regular, or other organisation
 - Next stage map leverages commodity in bottom right
 - Modern, simple, cheaper things that work well. People don't mind they are not "special", they like the better tools.
 - What about the uncertainty? Well, on the basis we're 90% the same as anything else we'll be able to adapt.
 - 

Paul Shetler
 - Hundreds of sites in Australian govt
 - Using engagement as a metric, but... nobody wants to engage with you. People want to get shit done.
 - Asked agencies to do 3 things: 1) start with user needs, 2) experiment and deliver the smallest improvement quickly, 3) agile + multidisciplinary teams
 - Timeboxes mitigate ocean boiling. Apply strict timeframes, force descoping.
 - Break the big system down. Where are the bottlenecks?
 - Iron law of bureaucracy: organisations want to maintain themselves in their current form
 - Deskilled workforce: outsourcing and privatisation deskill government, reduce skills and breed incompetance
 - Square of despair: inappropriate governance, procurement, IT, funding
 - Australia context: digital skills shortage country-wide. It's a problem for the country.
 - "Internet marketplace is red in tooth and claw" i.e. Amazon will eat everyone, Aus needs to look at industrial policy
 - Concept of spinning out "labs" from your org. If your org is operating in the square of despair the product of your labs will die.
 - Hackathons and design theatre: same problem. If you can't actually progress the outcomes they are counter productive.
 - Lipstick on a pig front ends: that is not serious
 - "Evolution not revolution" should be banned. This is a path to go out of business.
 - 2-speed / bi-modal: you are creating new legacy, setting up warring camps. Winners and losers.
 - Digital cultism / agile everywhere. It's not always appropriate. If it's not new, unusual, unknown - why would you use agile?
 - You need the political will to change. Inertia is the name of the game. People have been there forever. You need political pressure to break inertia.
 - Put a senior minister in charge. End of career not beginning. Fine with causing controvery, they won't be loved.
 - Change the management
 - If you're under existential threat, maybe get rid of the frozen middle.
 - Work with human nature.
 - Fix the basics. Answer the friggin' phones.
 - I.e. NSW did it in Aus. Earned a lot of political capital with users. 
 - Change has to go into the back office. What is the user trying to get done? Help them.
 - Automate everything. We are told people want a human touch. In reality people prefer a consistent, high quality outcome. Whether or not that's a human.
 - Stop talking about "engagement"
 - Square of despair driven by downskilled staff. You must radically upskill, from the bottom up.
 - New digital professionals, recruit from the front line. I.e. digital academies in UK.
 - Dismantle the square of despair. Funding is a huge problem. If you need a big business case for an experiment you're doing it wrong.
 - Procurement in days if not minutes.
 - Simplify and consolidate governance. 
 - Institute spend controls. Nothing is going to work without that. Gives you a map of what's going on, can stop bad behaviour, steer towards to right things.
 - End the digital / IT / product split.
 - Fit governance to the problem, method, aptitude.

Chris Adams
 - Mapping by Example
 - How do I talk about what's hapening in my org?
 - Business model canvas? Product roadmap?
 - Tells me the what and the now, but not the why and the future
 - We are planning to detect icebergs by ramming them
 - Useful features of maps: anchor: keep user in the picture, position: how are we set up to meet their needs?, movement: how might things change
 - Maps help with movement in a  unique way, are information dense, and explicit
 - Mapped value chain for website company + added evolution
 - It looks messy at first, that's fine
 - Client doesn't say "good job on configuring Postgres Chris!". Doesn't happen.
 - Will I get better at ops than Amazon? No
 - Will clients expect us to be familiar with the things on the right? Yes.
 - Growing Communities company in Hackney. Legacy website, lots of problems. What to do? Map.
 - What the core user need? Veg boxes.
 - Spent a couple of times looking into writing an open source thing but found out how hard it is
 - "Mapunditry"
 - How the battle of cloud was lost example. Map Amazon vs traditional.
 - Another example: Why would FB send the GDP of Iceland on WhatsApp?
 - Monetizing the social graph: the people who know each other
 - WhatsApp was a messaging app choking FBs value chain: keep in touch with your family without eyeballs in front of FB ads
 - How to get practice mapping? 
 - AWMUG (Amateur Wardley Mapping User Group)
 - https://awmug.org

Liz Keogh
 - Cynefin (sounds like "kernevin")
 - Epiphany vs Apophany
 - Apophany, Claus Konrad coined, means the kind of epiphany schizophrenics have: seeing patterns that aren't there.
 - Example: a photo of the surface of Mars that looks like an elephant.
 - Some conservation groups don't recognise the discovery that there are two species of African elephants, because their tracking systems can't cope
 - Apophenia simultaneously extremely useful and highly hazardous
 - We filter the data we observe
 - Beliefs dictate how we filter data: this produces confirmation bias
 - Pareidolia, actor-observer bias, Google effect... there are so many biases we suffer from
 - Our brains are broken when it comes to understanding uncertainty
 - There is an assuption that there is order and predictability
 - Cynefin framework. Obvious things, complicated things, chaos, complexity
 - Obvious things, complicated things => predictable outcomes
 - Chaos => need to act quickly
 - Complex => cause and effect can be correlated, but only in retrospect
 - Obvious: sense, categorise, respond
 - Complicated: sense, analyse, respond
 - Chaotic: act, sense, respond
 - Complex: probe, sense, respond
 - Emergent outcomes, processes
 - In the middle is disorder, we can Eapply our preferred pattern to disorder but it tends to chaos
 - Systems are complex and adaptive, agents can change the system
 - Estimating complexity
 - 5: Nobody has ever done it before
 - 4: Someone outside the org has
 - 3: Someone in the company has done it
 - 2: Someone in the team has
 - 1: We all know how to do it
 - 5 to 1 moves from complex to obvious
 - Things that are 1s: should they be commodities?
 - Safe-to-fail Rpbes: know if it's succeeding or not? Have lever to dampen or amplify. Coherence: a realistic reason to think the probes might succeed.
 - Coherence: "Can you give me an example"
 - BDD approaches: given x then y, z
 - We often don't try things because there's a "but it won't work" voice in our heads
 - Correlation in retrospect
 - Second order effects: more police on the street = more crime reported because people reporting crime to them
 - Cognitive Edge "Sensemaker", gathers
 - Identify "dispositions" in systems, find ways to change from bad ones to good ones
 - Where is change landing and succeeding? Listen out.
 - Use existing disposition
 - Complexity is dominated by relationships. Don't just think about nodes, think about relationships. That's what you are changing.
 - Relentless positivity. If you want to get things going you need to be relentless.
 - Get people started, break the initial inertia.
 - We notice what we do wrong more than what we do right.


James Findlay & James Duncan
 ... Missed first half of talk
 - Von Neumann & his contribution of computing
 - ENIAC, for calculating the trajectory of artillery shells was being built
 - Von N had been working on Manhattan Project, but worked out that ENIAC could be modified to a general purpose machine
 - He got it to do a load of work on atom bomb things
 - EDVAC paper proposed architecture which we still use today in x86 and similar
 - Von N made use of commodity valves... as if he had a map

Adrian Cockcroft, @adrianco
 - Mapping AI
 - VP at AWS
 - OSS programme at AWS
 - Was at Netflix doing OSS
 - Part of Cloud Native Foundation
 - AI was a thing, and they identified MXNet as an academic project they might sponsor
 - They had a go at mapping MXNet
 - Improve docs, make easier to migrate from TensorFlow
 - Move it from being a uni project to be incubated by Apache
 - Simon W contributed to the maps, introduced concept of pipeline for research (custom) to pre-trained models
 - Introduced plays such as investing in high level frameworks for MXNet, partner (and control supply) of best new GPU chips (NVIDIA) etc.
 - Looked at every team in Amazon and what they are doing in AI: shops team etc.
 - MXNet used by WolframAlpha, Pinterest, self driving car systems
 - Future state map: commoditised everything, academia continues to feed the models

Tal Klein
 - Mapping in the context of science fiction
 - Think about Dr Evil's motivation in Austin Powers: world domination
 - Strategy: sharks with frikkin' laser beams
 - Actually sharks are not a commodity. To achieve sharks with laser beams he'd have to become the most ecologically friendly supervillain ever.
 - There were a load of bad assumptions.
 - We assume that maps solve our strategy problems. We can't draw maps to justify our conclusions.
 - The Martian does it well.
 - Ready Player One makes a fundamental assumption: everyone will be plugged into a VR framework. Mixed reality actually more likely.
 - To take another supervillain... like Putin. Leverage commodity things, like social media, and add propaganda and fake news etc.!
 - In the Punch Escrow he writes about a future where he has used mapping to try to work out what it will look like.
