 - Gov must move from silos to platforms
 - Introduction of open standards and data
 - Coding in the open means sharing
 - Common standards means common tools
 - Outcome based teams
 - Change needs spend controls
 - Square of despair: procurement, security, legacy, capability
 - Institute for Government encouraged tyranny of agile
 - How can we get to AGILE(tm)? Doing it properly
 - Mapping tells us which techniques to use
 - Cassian Young: how would you do this in a dept. and how would you use a map?
 - Mapped incident management using maps
 - Identified utilities, things that could be SaaS
 - Identified areas of custom
 - What's up with hosting?
 - Gov spending Â£1.6bn per year on hosting
 - Lots of hosting comes with added lock-in in contract
 - Gov lock ins broken by Crown Hosting, the "Hotel California" where you check in your legacy but where it can never leave
 - Depts can then move on
 - Used open to unlock change
 - Competition could then drive technology model
 - High degree of open source
 - High engagement from SMEs
 - What is a minimum viable agency?
 - PaaS, Registers, Open source -> multidisciplinary teams -> GOV.UK, supported by user research, continuous delivery
