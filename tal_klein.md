## Mapping in the context of science fiction

 - Think about Dr Evil's motivation in Austin Powers: world domination
 - Strategy: sharks with frikkin' laser beams
 - Actually sharks are not a commodity. To achieve sharks with laser beams he'd have to become the most ecologically friendly supervillain ever.
 - There were a load of bad assumptions.
 - We assume that maps solve our strategy problems. We can't draw maps to justify our conclusions.
 - The Martian does it well.
 - Ready Player One makes a fundamental assumption: everyone will be plugged into a VR framework. Mixed reality actually more likely.
 - To take another supervillain... like Putin. Leverage commodity things, like social media, and add propaganda and fake news etc.!
 - In the Punch Escrow he writes about a future where he has used mapping to try to work out what it will look like.
