# Paul Shetler

 - Hundreds of sites in Australian govt
 - Using engagement as a metric, but... nobody wants to engage with you. People want to get shit done.
 - Asked agencies to do 3 things: 1) start with user needs, 2) experiment and deliver the smallest improvement quickly, 3) agile + multidisciplinary teams
 - Timeboxes mitigate ocean boiling. Apply strict timeframes, force descoping.
 - Break the big system down. Where are the bottlenecks?
 - Iron law of bureaucracy: organisations want to maintain themselves in their current form
 - Deskilled workforce: outsourcing and privatisation deskill government, reduce skills and breed incompetance
 - Square of despair: inappropriate governance, procurement, IT, funding
 - Australia context: digital skills shortage country-wide. It's a problem for the country.
 - "Internet marketplace is red in tooth and claw" i.e. Amazon will eat everyone, Aus needs to look at industrial policy
 - Concept of spinning out "labs" from your org. If your org is operating in the square of despair the product of your labs will die.
 - Hackathons and design theatre: same problem. If you can't actually progress the outcomes they are counter productive.
 - Lipstick on a pig front ends: that is not serious
 - "Evolution not revolution" should be banned. This is a path to go out of business.
 - 2-speed / bi-modal: you are creating new legacy, setting up warring camps. Winners and losers.
 - Digital cultism / agile everywhere. It's not always appropriate. If it's not new, unusual, unknown - why would you use agile?
 - You need the political will to change. Inertia is the name of the game. People have been there forever. You need political pressure to break inertia.
 - Put a senior minister in charge. End of career not beginning. Fine with causing controvery, they won't be loved.
 - Change the management
 - If you're under existential threat, maybe get rid of the frozen middle.
 - Work with human nature.
 - Fix the basics. Answer the friggin' phones.
 - I.e. NSW did it in Aus. Earned a lot of political capital with users. 
 - Change has to go into the back office. What is the user trying to get done? Help them.
 - Automate everything. We are told people want a human touch. In reality people prefer a consistent, high quality outcome. Whether or not that's a human.
 - Stop talking about "engagement"
 - Square of despair driven by downskilled staff. You must radically upskill, from the bottom up.
 - New digital professionals, recruit from the front line. I.e. digital academies in UK.
 - Dismantle the square of despair. Funding is a huge problem. If you need a big business case for an experiment you're doing it wrong.
 - Procurement in days if not minutes.
 - Simplify and consolidate governance. 
 - Institute spend controls. Nothing is going to work without that. Gives you a map of what's going on, can stop bad behaviour, steer towards to right things.
 - End the digital / IT / product split.
 - Fit governance to the problem, method, aptitude.
